description: Implement a CHANGE record linked to an Accepted ADR after confirmation
---

# Workflow

1. Read `.logtrail/changes.md` and `.logtrail/adl.md`.
2. Select work:
   - If input starts with `CHANGE-00014`, `CHANGE 00014`, `C-00014`, `#14`, `#014`, `014`, or `14`, prefer the matching CHANGE record when it exists.
   - Otherwise select the lowest-numbered non-`Done`, non-`Abandoned` CHANGE
3. Stop unless the selected CHANGE exists.
4. Stop unless every linked ADR exists and has status `Accepted`.
5. Read the selected CHANGE and linked ADRs.
6. Summarize decision context, change scope, implementation steps, verification, and rollback.
7. Wait for user confirmation.
8. Implement the CHANGE and run its verification.
9. If verification passes, update the CHANGE file and `.logtrail/changes.md` status to `Done`.
10. If verification fails, leave status unchanged and report failures.

# Guardrails

- Do not infer missing CHANGE records.
- If implementation needs to change an ADR decision, stop and ask for a new or updated ADR.
- If implementation needs a different scope than the CHANGE describes, stop and ask whether to update the CHANGE first.
