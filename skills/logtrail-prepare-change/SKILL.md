name: Logtrail | Prepare Change
description: Create a new Proposed CHANGE record for ADR-backed or standalone implementation work
---

Use the text after this skill invocation as the change brief.

Use this skill only to prepare CHANGE documentation. Inspect code as needed, but write only CHANGE docs and `.logtrail/changes.md`.

## Resources

- Use `assets/change-template.md` as the CHANGE template.

## Workflow

1. If the brief does not identify implementation work, ask for the change topic before creating files.
2. Read `.logtrail/changes.md`, `.logtrail/adl.md`, relevant ADRs/docs/code, and inspect current state.
3. Apply the ADR-backed change gate before creating files:
   - If the brief references ADRs, verify that each ADR exists and is `Accepted`.
   - Use ADR-backed changes when implementation work follows an `Accepted` ADR.
   - If the work introduces or changes a durable decision that constrains future work, architecture, repository structure, public contracts, generated output, build/test workflow, dependencies, or reversibility, stop and explain that ADR Prepare must run first.
   - Use standalone changes only for concrete implementation work that does not need a new ADR: routine bug fixes, local refactors, test additions, implementation details of an existing ADR, copy changes, dependency patch updates, or choices that only matter inside one task.
4. Determine CHANGE number:
   - Use an explicit number only when it appears at the start of input, after optional whitespace.
   - Supported prefixes: `CHANGE-014`, `CHANGE 014`, `C-014`, `#14`, `#014`, `014`, `14`.
   - Normalize to five digits: `#14 Split decisions` -> `CHANGE-00014`, `.logtrail/changes/change-00014-split-decisions.md`.
   - Do not scan the input body for CHANGE numbers.
   - If no starting number exists, use max `CHANGE-NNNNN` from `.logtrail/changes.md` + 1.
5. Stop if `.logtrail/changes/change-NNNNN-title-slug.md` already exists.
6. Present a rough approach before writing:
   - goal
   - ADR links or standalone rationale
   - scope
   - implementation shape
   - verification
   - rollback
7. Ask clarifying questions only when the answer changes scope, compatibility, verification, or rollback.
8. Create `.logtrail/changes/change-NNNNN-title-slug.md` from `assets/change-template.md`.
   - If you estimate that change takes more than 500 lines, create several subsequent CHANGE files, each one blocked by previous
9. Save CHANGE and `.logtrail/changes.md` entry with status `Proposed`.
10. Stop after docs/status changes. Do not implement code.

## Guardrails

- Do not change implementation code, ADR files, configs, or tests.
- Do not overwrite existing CHANGE files.
- Do not mark CHANGE as `Done`.
- Do not treat numbers in input body as CHANGE numbers.
- Do not create standalone CHANGE records for work that needs a new ADR first. Stop and explain why ADR Prepare is required.
- Linking to a `Rejected`, `Deprecated`, or `Superseded` ADR requires explicit user confirmation.
