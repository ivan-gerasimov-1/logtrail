# Agent Working Context

The role of this file is to describe common mistakes and confusion points that agents might encounter while working in this project.

If you encounter anything in the project that is surprising, unclear, or worth preserving as a recurring preference, convention, constraint, or project-specific rule, alert the developer you are working with and record it in the `Learned Conventions` section.

## General Guardrails

- Avoid editing automatically generated files.
- Install dependencies using `--save-exact` to ensure deterministic builds.
- Name files and directories using camelCase.
- If the user’s intent changes between turns, re-evaluate and switch to the matching skill before taking action.

## Commits

- Write commit messages in English.
- Use Conventional Commits:
  - `feat`: new functionality
  - `fix`: bug fixes
  - `docs`: documentation
  - `style`: formatting
  - `refactor`: refactoring
  - `test`: tests
  - `chore`: maintenance

Example commit message:

```text
chore(*): cleanup code
```

## Engineering Conventions

- Before writing or changing code, read [engineering-conventions.md](./docs/engineering-conventions.md).
- Architecture decisions are tracked in [.backtrail/adl.md](.backtrail/adl.md).
